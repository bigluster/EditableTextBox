# EditableTextBox

QlikSense Project. Editable Text Box. It also habilitates the text and applies different colors depending on the condition. Habilitates CSS for the layout of each line.

Version of 2.0:
  - We substituted measures by arrays, which has granted the full control of each line. However, Version 2.0 of this application will only be compatible with qlik sense 2.2 and above. For older versions, please consider using Editable TextBox version 1.2;
  - Now each line can be configured separately, including the integer and alphanumerical evaluation;
  - Now each line has its own CSS configuration box;
